## INTRODUCTION:

Modeling equations with the Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101 (ETT 101) demonstrates how electrical signals can represent mathematical relationships. By combining and manipulating signals using modules like the Adder and Phase Shifter, it is possible to observe the effects of amplitude and phase changes, providing a practical understanding of signal behavior and analog system operations.

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RESULTS

### 1. Implementing an Equation to the ETT 101

In the first part of the experiment, the student will use the adder module of the ETT 101 in order to add two electrical signal together. It will be implementing the equation:

1.1 Two 2 kHz sine wave signals were used as input and passed through the Phase Shifter and Adder Module. In the first part, we used the Adder Module to combine the two 2 kHz sine signals, as shown in the figure below.

#### 1.2 Using the Gain Control function, we adjusted the gain until the output matched the size of the input. In the experiment, we measured an output voltage of 3.8 V and an input voltage of 3.8 V, which clearly shows that **Voltage Output = Voltage Input** when the gain is properly adjusted.

### 2. Phase-Shifted Input through Adder Module

After that, we changed the other input of the Adder Module and first passed it through the Phase Shifter Module, with the output then connected back to the Adder Module, as shown in the figure below.

2.1 As observed, the output voltage is now different from the previous case when the same input signal passed through the Adder alone. While the output voltage, frequency, and period remain the same, it is clearly observable that the **phase of the output signal has changed**. This occurs because one input is a regular sine wave, while the other is a phase-shifted signal. When these signals are combined, the result is a sine wave with a phase shift corresponding to the adjusted input.

## Conclusion
- After analyzing the gathered data and observations in how to model an equation using the Emona Telecoms-Trainer 101, the following conclusions have been made:
The Adder Module of the ETT 101 effectively implements the summation of two input signals, demonstrating that electrical signals can be combined to model mathematical equations.
- Proper use of the Gain Control allows the output voltage to match the input voltage, confirming that the system can accurately scale signals when modeling equations.
- Introducing a phase-shifted signal into the Adder Module produces an output signal with a modified phase while maintaining the same amplitude and frequency, illustrating how phase manipulation affects signal combination.
