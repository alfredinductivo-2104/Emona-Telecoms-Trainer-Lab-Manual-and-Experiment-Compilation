# AM MODULATION - Emona Telecoms Trainer Lab Manual and Experiment Compilation (PART 1) 

## Background

The **Emona Telecoms Trainer 101** is an educational platform used by students to study the fundamental principles of **Communications and Telecommunications**. It provides a hands-on learning experience by allowing students to implement, observe, and analyze various communication system block diagrams using real hardware modules.

Through the use of the Emona Telecoms Trainer, students are able to explore key concepts in both **Analog** and **Digital Communications**, including:
- Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- Frequency Modulation (FM)
- Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
- Other fundamental communication techniques

This hands-on approach enables students to develop a deeper understanding of how communication systems operate—from **signal generation**, **modulation and demodulation**, **filtering**, and **amplification**, to overall system analysis.

The compiled set of experiments documents the **procedures**, **observations**, **results**, and **key notes** for each activity. Additionally, this compilation serves as a reference guide for other students by providing clear explanations, practical insights, and helpful tips to support effective experiment execution and deeper conceptual understanding.









🧪 Experiment 1: Setting Up an Oscilloscope
📘 Introduction

An oscilloscope is an electronic measuring device used to analyze and observe electrical signals. It allows users to visualize signal characteristics such as waveform shape, frequency, and amplitude. In addition, an oscilloscope can measure important signal parameters including:

Period (T)

Frequency (f)

Peak Voltage (Vp)

Peak-to-Peak Voltage (Vpp)

Time intervals

Oscilloscopes are widely used in electronics laboratories for testing, troubleshooting, and verifying the performance of electronic circuits and systems.
